# device [![NPM version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/device.svg?style=flat)](https://npmjs.org/package/device) [![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/device.svg?style=flat)](https://npmjs.org/package/device) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rguerreiro/device.png?branch=main)](http://travis-ci.org/rguerreiro/device)

## device

Basically the [express-device](https://github.com/rguerreiro/express-device) gained life of it's own and I had to refactor the basic functionality (it makes sense). Many were using [express-device](https://github.com/rguerreiro/express-device) only to identify the type of device and didn't want all the [express](http://expressjs.com) stuff.

## how to use it?

    $ npm install device

Here's an example on how to use it:

```javascript
var device = require('device');
var mydevice = device('put here user-agent string');

if(mydevice.is('bot'))
	// do something...
else
	// do another thing...
```
By doing this you're getting an object that have the following properties:
<table>
    <tr><td><strong>Name</strong></td><td><strong>Field Type</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td><td><strong>Possible Values</strong></td></tr>
    <tr>
        <td>type</td>
        <td>string</td>
        <td>It gets the device type for the parsed user-agent string</td>
        <td>desktop, tv, tablet, phone, bot or car</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>model</td>
        <td>string</td>
        <td>It gets the device model name for the parsed user-agent string</td>
        <td>Example: iPhone. If the option <strong>parseUserAgent</strong> is set to false, then it will return an empty string</td>
    </tr>
</table>

It accepts an object with only the config options you which to override (go [here](https://github.com/rguerreiro/device/blob/master/test/not_default_options_test.js) for some examples). The ones you don't override it will use the default values. Here's the list with the available config options:
<table>
    <tr><td><strong>Name</strong></td><td><strong>Field Type</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td><td><strong>Possible Values</strong></td></tr>
    <tr>
        <td>emptyUserAgentDeviceType</td>
        <td>string</td>
        <td>Device type to be returned whenever the has an empty user-agent. Defaults to desktop.</td>
        <td>desktop, tv, tablet, phone, bot, car or console</td>
    </tr>
	<tr>
        <td>unknownUserAgentDeviceType</td>
        <td>string</td>
        <td>Device type to be returned whenever the user-agent is unknown. Defaults to phone.</td>
        <td>desktop, tv, tablet, phone, bot, car or console</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>botUserAgentDeviceType</td>
        <td>string</td>
        <td>Device type to be returned whenever the user-agent belongs to a bot. Defaults to bot.</td>
        <td>desktop, tv, tablet, phone, bot, car or console</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>carUserAgentDeviceType</td>
        <td>string</td>
        <td>Device type to be returned whenever the user-agent belongs to a car. Defaults to car.</td>
        <td>desktop, tv, tablet, phone, bot, car or console</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>consoleUserAgentDeviceType</td>
        <td>string</td>
        <td>Device type to be returned whenever the user-agent belongs to a console. Defaults to tv.</td>
        <td>desktop, tv, tablet, phone, bot, car or console</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>tvUserAgentDeviceType</td>
        <td>string</td>
        <td>Device type to be returned whenever the user-agent belongs to a tv. Defaults to tv.</td>
        <td>desktop, tv, tablet, phone, bot, car or console</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>parseUserAgent</td>
        <td>bool</td>
        <td>Configuration to parse the user-agent string using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/useragent">useragent</a> npm package. It's needed in order to get the device name. Defaults to false.</td>
        <td>true | false</td>
    </tr>
</table>

In case you didn't notice there's also a method **is()** that will return a boolean (true or false) when you pass the device type that you want validate against (check the initial example).

The **device** package is supported on node version 10.* upwards.

Special thanks to [@jimmybergman](https://github.com/jimmybergman) that allowed me to use his `device` package for this refactoring.

## where to go from here?

Currently, `device` is on **version 0.3.12**. In order to add more features I'm asking anyone to contribute with some ideas. You can do it by making some feature requests on the issues panel, but I prefer that you make your contribution with some pull requests ;)

In case you found a misinterpreted user-agent please open an issue and submit the full string and state what type of device it should return.
